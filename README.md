## Contract VIN (Vinus In Numeris)

This contract implements a factory of FA2 NFT. Each FA2 contract represents a collection of wine bottles. Wine bottles are represented by tokens inside a FA2 contract.
When originating a collection of bottle,
- the creator must specify a collection name and a QR code for each bottle.
- the creator owns all bottles of the collection

The creator of the collection can also add new bottles to his collection anytime (with the *Mint* entrypoint)

A bottle owner can transfer one or more bottle to someone else (with the *Transfer* entrypoint)

A collection of bottles is represented by a FA2 contract. The implementation of the FA2 introduces:
- a admin address on the storage which represents the creator of the FA2 contract
- a *Mint* entrypoint that allows the creator of the FA2 to create new tokens inside the NFT contract
- a *token_usage* map that count the number of transfer of a bottle
- a *token_usage* view for retrieving the number of transfer of a bottle (for a given token_id)

An extra Marketplace smart contract has been provided to illustrate how to make a secondary market on these Nft. The Marketplace contract allows Nft owners to sell their wine bottles on a secondary market. The Marketplace contract allows users to accept a sell proposal.
The Marketplace smart contract is not meant for production purpose.
